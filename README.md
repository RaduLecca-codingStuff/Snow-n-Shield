# Snow-n-Shield
"Snow'n Shield" is a minigame I worked on for an internship at SyncVR Medical to aid people who recover from burn injuries in managing pain during treatment. The SyncVR application that the minigame is a part of is owned by SyncVR Medical and I do not claim ownership of it, therefore I only included the files for the minigame itself.
